## Why did I make this?

During my First year of Engineering, we were learning C. On one fine day, we were taught bubble sort and linear search in the same day. 
Linear search was intuitive and made sense. Bubble sort didn't.

I disliked how it worked. The lab work was majorly focused on learning C, but I really did want to come up with a better algorithm. 

I knew there is definetly something better than bubble sort, I just didn't know their names. 


I took a challenge by NOT googling what those algorithms are, and not asking chatgpt for any help either. I really just wanted to see what
I can come up with solely by myself. 

I had a direction, I wanted to use Linear Search to improve it. That's why the name, LSalgo (Linear Search Sort algorithm)

It took 7-8 iterations (not all of them are in this repo) for me to come up with lsalgo4.c

And as you may have noticed, it is selection sort. While nothing impressive or crazy, I was happy that I was able to come up with it myself without any help. 


## Takeaway

I learned that writing code about things I feel for feels way more better than anything else. 
Even if the code itself is just stupid, I happen to enjoy writing.
